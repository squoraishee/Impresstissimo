# Impresstissimo

Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by its emphasis on capturing the fleeting moments and changing qualities of light and color in everyday life. Some of the most well-known Impressionist artists include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas. 

Over time, many Impressionist paintings have become degraded and damaged due to age, exposure to light, and other factors. By developing a CNN to restore degraded Impressionist paintings, we can help to preserve and digitize cultural heritage artifacts for future generations.
